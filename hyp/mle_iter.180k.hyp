the car usage in the united states is very important in every day life , swell as in many american countries , and third world countries .
however , companies tend to cut their profits for workers .
many people are willing to buy these cars .
the one is a copper school .
another solution could be the developing of more fuel efficient cars , which could also be good for america 's car manufacturers who will produce more attractive cars to sell to other countries .
consequently , i agree the statement with regard to three reasons : affecting the view , face to face with people and the first time .
first of all , the population of the world is going down .
my wife and i always go to tokyo around december .
therefore , the problem of running out of fuel is out of the question , thereby considering my view that the number of cars will continue to rise and not decline .
the first effect is global warming .

high cost produces high quality medicine .
this is an important thing .
books some times have an old information so it will be wrong .
against those problems , people started to use cheaper transportation instead of cars .
however , i agree that having knowledge is being useful whenever we necessary information .
but when the teacher asked me , i said yes .
so i disagree with the statement and i think it is much better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
raising tax for gas can be the most effective and possible way to decrease the use of gas in three reasons .

the age , in my view , sometimes is a barrier to do something in life .
in simple words they say they lost their appeal .

i believe that the product 's quality mentioned in the shops are exactly the same as given in the recognized .
then , define your goals and work hard to achieve them .

if students just learn facts , they will forget them soon , but this will not happen so easily if they understand properly the concepts that are behind the facts .
as on when i started completing my home work on time i gradually improved .
because if i study in this way of course , i will gate so much , i also will have a lot of information the book i study .
when you understand the concepts and ideas is up to you to prove them , to see if they are really what you have been told , i think this is the main reason why students prefer facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts .
for example , if you are striving to study arts and sciences and to get qualifications in both , you are extraordinary creation .

for example , little children are told that do not cross the street at red light , because it is so dangerous that we can not let kids learn from crash .
in my opinion students need to use knowledge .
so because more people are able to buy cars the demand for cars will increase and so the production of cars will also increase and in the end this means that the number of cars will increase from now to twenty years time .
