every time when we meet , i will look forward to new things .
although some people say that the treasure are already found .
as far as i am concerned i agree with this statement , however some people do not agree with my opinion .
the car usage in the united states is very important in every day life .
however , companies tend to cut their profits for workers .
many people are willing to buy these cars .
the one is a good-bye school .
another solution could be the developing of more fuel efficient cars , which could also be good for america 's car manufacturers who will produce more attractive cars to sell to other countries .
consequently , i agree with regard to three reasons : based on view , face to face with people and the first time .
first of all , the population of the world is going down .
my wife and i always go to tokyo around december .
thereby the problem of running out of fuels is out of the question thereby 'over my view that the number of cars will continue to rise and not decline .
the first affection is global warming .
so , ho chi minh city will develop
people like to drive different types of models and they want some things extra in it .

that 's why i will not be hard as i am alone .
high cost produces high quality medicine .
this is an important thing .
books some times have an old information so it will be wrong .
against those problems , people started to use cheaper transportation instead of the car .
however , i agree that having knowledge is being useful whenever we necessary information .
but when the teacher asked me , i said yes .
so i disagree with the statement and i think it is much better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
raising tax for the gas can be the most effective and possible way to decrease the use of gas in three reasons .
next , kids are more attractive to the advertisements .

if they can not pay high prices any more , people have to change into a bus or a train .
this will reduce the pollution caused by the ambiance of cars .
moreover they have to learn about advance course material .
the age , in my view , sometimes is a barrier to do something in life .
in simple words they say they lost their appeal .
for example , nursing students study in a nursing college for five years .
i believe that the product 's quality mentioned in the shops are exactly the same as given in the assumption .
then , define your goals and work hard to achieve them .
critics of this policy focus in three sides ; first , fleming fire overcame a large area of land therefore a lot of plant species were lost .

if students just learn facts , they will forget them soon , but this will not happen so easily if they understand properly the concepts that are behind the facts .
as on when i started completing my home work on time i gradually improved .
because if i study in this way of course , i will settle so much .
when you understand the concepts and ideas is up to you to prove them , to see if they are really what you have been told , i think this is the main reason why students prefer facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts .
for example , if you are striving to study arts and sciences and to get qualifications in both , you are extraordinary creation .
therefore , as long as it is a country where i can understand their language , i will travel alone .

there will be technological development in the future , but that will only promote the use of public transportation system , but not car .

not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n't be able to .
the election video clips of a juicy hamburger flying around the screen , surely satisfying the models eating it could easily create in the viewers a false sense of being hungry and urge them to hop into their car and drive to a fast food restaurant nearby to get what they have seen .

of course , things are new and very risky .
for example , little children are told that do not cross the street at red light , because it is so dangerous that we can not let kids learn from crash .
in my opinion , students need to be knowledge .
